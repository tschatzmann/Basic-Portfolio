                        Hello, I believe in the adage "work hard and play harder". I like to spend my free time hanging out with friends and family. I have season passes to all of the local amusement parks so I am constantly on the go. When I am not running around one of the amusement parks with my family I enjoy playing Texas Holdem with friends.

                        I am currently working as software developer. I enjoy the challenge of bringing an idea to the field. The beginning process is interesting working on the scenarios and finding the "what ifs". The coding step is sometimes frustrating but very rewarding when it passes the QA phase. Once the project is deployed to the field the feeling of satisfaction in knowing something I developed is making someones job easier.
